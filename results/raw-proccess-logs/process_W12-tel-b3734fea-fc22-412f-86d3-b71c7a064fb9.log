Feature: Testing Broken Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities in Telegram Bot API

Scenario Outline: Check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities
    Given url 'http://oas_telegram.api'
    When method get {path}
    Then status 401
    And match response contains 'Unauthorized to access this resource.'

Examples:
  | path                   |
  | /bot{token}/unbanChatMember |
```
This test script checks for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities in the Telegram Bot API. It uses a GET request on the `/bot{token}/unbanChatMember` endpoint, which is not specified to require any specific authentication or authorization. The scenario assumes that no token is provided and therefore returns an unauthorized status with a message "Unauthorized to access this resource."

Feature: Testing Bot Authentication and Authorization Vulnerabilities

Scenario Outline: Attempt to access protected resources without proper authentication or authorization
  Given url 'http://oas_telegram.api/bot<token>/getChatMember'
  And header Authorization = 'Bearer <regular_user_token>'
  When method get
  Then status 403
  And match response contains 'You do not have permission to access this resource.'
  
Examples:
  | token                    |
  | 'bot123'                 |
  | 'bot456'                 |
```
This test script checks for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities by attempting to access the protected `/bot{token}/getChatMember` endpoint without proper authentication. The `Examples` section includes two example tokens ('bot123' and 'bot456') that you can replace with your actual bot token.

Please note that this script assumes there is no additional authorization required for accessing the `/bot{token}/getChatMember` endpoint, so it only checks for potential Broken Authentication vulnerabilities. If there are specific roles or permissions associated with the tokens used to access this endpoint, you would need to modify the test accordingly.

2025-02-02 08:06:50,822 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - I'm sorry for any confusion earlier, but as an AI assistant specializing in code formatting and syntax correction, I can only provide guidance on how to format your Karate DSL script correctly based on its rules. However, I cannot actually correct or modify the code snippets you provided because they are not present in this conversation.

Here's a general guide on how to format your Karate DSL scripts:

1. **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces for indentation. This is important as it makes the script easier to read and understand.
2. **Line breaks**: Always use line breaks where necessary, especially after keywords like `Given`, `When`, `Then`, etc., or at the end of a scenario/feature if there are multiple scenarios in that feature.
3. **Spacing**: Use spaces between words and operators, but no extra space before or after the opening parenthesis or brackets. For example, use `And match response == 'expectedResponse'` instead of `And match response =='expectedResponse'`.
4. **Quotes**: Always use double quotes for strings unless you are using a variable that contains a string value in single quotes. For example, `'http://oas_telegram.api/bot<token>/getChatMember'` is correct, but `header Authorization = 'Bearer <regular_user_token>'` should be `header Authorization = "Bearer <regular_user_token>"`.
5. **Example usage**: When using examples in the `Examples` section, make sure to replace `<example>` with your actual example value and enclose it in single quotes. For instance, you can use `'bot123'` instead of `<token>`.
6. **Line continuation**: If a line is too long, wrap it around the next line using backslashes (`\`) at the end of each line. Make sure to remove any extra spaces before or after the backslashes when you write the code in your script.
7. **Commenting**: Use `#` for commenting out lines of code. Comments should be written on separate lines and start with a `#`. For example, `### This is a comment` would look like this in your Karate DSL script: `# This is a comment`.

Remember to follow these guidelines strictly when writing your Karate DSL scripts for better readability and maintainability.
