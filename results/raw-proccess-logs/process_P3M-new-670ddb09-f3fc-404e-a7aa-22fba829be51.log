Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights. If you do not use the same client ID for a user across multiple requests, then Bing may assign the user to multiple conflicting flights. Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.

The relevance improvements help with better quality of results delivered by Bing APIs and in turn enables higher click-through rates for the API consumer.

  @name Unauthorized Access Attempts without Valid Credentials on Trending Topics Endpoint
  description: This feature verifies that the trending topics endpoint does not allow unauthorized access even when no authentication is required or if there's a misconfiguration.
  
  Context:
    Given url 'https://oas-news-search-client.api/v1/trendingtopics'
    
    Scenario Outline: Attempt to bypass unauthorized access on /news/trendingtopics endpoint with invalid or no credentials provided, expecting a 403 Forbidden status code response.
      Examples of headers and expected outcomes for various scenarios will be defined below the scenario outline using Karate's 'Given Header', '#{...}' tags to dynamically insert values from an examples table into each step where appropriate:
      
    Scenario Outline: Attempt unauthorized access on /news/trendingtopics endpoint.
      Given url '<%= context.url %>'
      And headers { 'Authorization': '', 'X-ApiKey': '' } # Empty credentials to simulate an unauthenticated request
      When method GET
      
      Then status should be 403 Forbidden
      // Explanation: This step ensures that the endpoint returns a 403 (Forbidden) response when no valid authentication is provided, indicating proper handling of unauthorized access attempts.
```

This script sets up an automated test to verify how well your API handles requests without appropriate authorization credentials for accessing trending topics information. By expecting and confirming a 403 Forbidden status code in response to these scenarios, you're checking that the endpoint correctly enforces access controls even when they might be misconfigured or overly strict.

Remember, this is just one aspect of security testing; comprehensive tests should cover various authentication methods and potential vulnerabilities across your API endpoints for a robust defense against unauthorized access attempts.
