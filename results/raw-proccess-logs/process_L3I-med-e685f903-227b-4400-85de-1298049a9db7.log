* assert adminAccess.response == "Admin has access to user publications"

```

This script includes three scenarios:

1. The first scenario checks for broken authentication by attempting to access the API endpoint without being authenticated.
2. The second scenario simulates a regular user trying to access the API endpoint, but with an invalid token or no role that allows them to view the publications.
3. The third scenario simulates an admin trying to access the API endpoint and verifies that they have the necessary permissions.

Note: You should replace `<regular_user_token>` and `<admin_token>` with actual tokens for a regular user and an admin, respectively.

This script tests the API endpoint `/me` for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities. It includes three scenarios:

1. The first scenario attempts to access the medium profile without authentication, which should return a `401 Unauthorized` error.
2. The second scenario attempts to access the medium profile with incorrect username and password, which should also return a `401 Unauthorized` error.
3. The third scenario attempts to access the medium profile with correct username and password, which should return a successful response.

Note that you'll need to replace `<wrong_username>`, `<correct_username>`, `<wrong_password>`, and `<correct_password>` with actual values for your API endpoint.
