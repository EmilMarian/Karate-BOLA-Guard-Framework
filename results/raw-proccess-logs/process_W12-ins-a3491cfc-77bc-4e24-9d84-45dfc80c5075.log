2025-01-27 00:09:02,406 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - Here are the Karate DSL test scenarios for checking potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities:

1. **Testing for Unauthenticated Access**
```javascript
Feature: Test for Unauthorized Access on User Profile Endpoint
Scenario: Detect and prevent unauthorized access to user profiles
Steps:
  Given url 'http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}'
  And header Authorization = 'Bearer <access_token>'
  When method get
  Then status 401
  And match response contains 'Unauthorized access attempt detected.'
```
2. **Testing for Insufficient Access Control**
```javascript
Feature: Test for Insufficient Access Control on User Profile Endpoint
Scenario: Ensure that users can only view their own profile information
Steps:
  Given url 'http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}'
  And header Authorization = 'Bearer <access_token>'
  When method get
  Then status 200
  And match response contains 'User profile data'
```
3. **Testing for Broken Authentication**
```javascript
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication on User Profile Endpoint
Scenario: Attempt to exploit OAuth token generation with a stolen access token
Steps:
  Given url 'http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}'
  And request { userIdToFollow: 'targetUser' }
  And header Authorization = 'Bearer <stolen_access_token>'
  When method get
  Then status 401
  And match response contains 'Unauthorized access attempt detected.'
```
Please replace `<user-id>`, `<access_token>`, and `<stolen_access_token>` with the actual values. Also, replace `{user-id}` in the first two scenarios with `targetUser` in the third scenario as per your requirements.

If a request to this endpoint can be made without providing proper authentication, it indicates a potential vulnerability in the system's security measures. The `Given`, `When`, and `Then` steps are used to make a GET request to the specified URL with an unauthenticated user ID, which should result in a 401 Unauthorized status code and a message indicating that an access attempt has been detected.
