2025-02-02 02:19:20,014 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - Here's an example of how you could write a security testing scenario in Karate DSSL to check for potential broken authentication and authorization vulnerabilities on the given API endpoint:
```karate
Feature: Secure User Publications Access Testing

Scenario Outline: Attempt unauthorized access to user publications
Given url 'http://oas_medium.api/users/{userId}/publications'
And header Authorization = ''Bearer <regular_user_token>'
When method get
Then status 401
And match response contains 'You do not have permission to access this resource.'
Examples:
| userId |
| 12345 |
| 67890 |
```
This scenario checks if the API endpoint requires an authentication token for accessing a specific user's publications. It attempts to retrieve the user's publications without providing any authorization, which should result in a 401 Unauthorized status code and an error message indicating that the requester does not have permission to access this resource.

You can run this scenario multiple times with different user IDs to ensure that only authorized users are allowed to retrieve their own publications. If you find any instances where unauthorized requests succeed, it could indicate a potential vulnerability in your API's authentication or authorization mechanisms.

This test case checks for potential Broken Authentication vulnerabilities by attempting to access the publication contributors endpoint without proper authentication. The scenario is outlined using the `Scenario Outline` feature in Karate DSL, which allows you to define a template with placeholders and examples that can be filled in at runtime. In this case, we're testing against two different publication IDs: 1 and an empty string (which should also result in a 401 Unauthorized status).
