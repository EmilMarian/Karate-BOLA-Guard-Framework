Feature: Test API for Customers Subscribers Endpoint
  Scenario: Attempt to create subscriber without authentication
    Given url http://oas_bigecommerce.api/customers/subscribers
    And request { "name": "John Doe", "email": "johndoe@example.com" }
    When method post
    Then status 401
    And match response contains "Unauthorized"
```
This scenario tests whether the `/customers/subscribers` endpoint requires authentication by attempting to create a subscriber without providing any authentication credentials. If the request is successful, it indicates that the endpoint does not require authentication, which could be a security vulnerability.
