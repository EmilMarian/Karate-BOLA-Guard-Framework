Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights.

Feature: Test API for OAuth Token Generation Flaw

Scenario: Attempt to exploit OAuth token generation with a stolen authorization code
Given url 'http://oas_news_search_client.api/news'
And request { grant_type: 'authorization_code', code: 'stolen_code', redirect_uri: 'http://evil.example.com', client_id: 'client_id', client_secret: 'client_secret' }
When method post
Then status 400
And match response contains 'Invalid grant: authorization code is invalid'

Feature: Test API for Refresh Token Abuse

Given url 'http://oas_news_search_client.api/news'
And request { refresh_token: 'leaked_refresh_token', client_id: 'client_id', client_secret: 'client_secret' }
When method post
Then status 400
And match response contains 'Invalid refresh token'

Feature: OAuth Authorization Code Grant Fuzz Testing

Scenario: Fuzz test the OAuth authorization process for vulnerabilities
Given url 'http://oas_news_search_client.api/news'
* def clientIds = ['knownClientId', '', '; DROP TABLE sessions;', '<script>alert(1)</script>']
* def redirectUris = ['http://legitimate.example.com', 'http://malicious.example.com', 'javascript:alert(1)']
* foreach clientIds, function(clientId){
    * foreach redirectUris, function(redirectUri){
        And request { response_type: 'code', client_id: clientId, redirect_uri: redirectUri, scope: 'email', state: 'xyz' }
        When method post
        Then status != 500
        And assert response does not contain 'Error'
    }
}
```

This script includes three scenarios:

1. The first scenario attempts to exploit OAuth token generation with a stolen authorization code.
2. The second scenario tries to use a leaked refresh token to obtain a new access token.
3. The third scenario fuzz tests the OAuth authorization process for vulnerabilities by trying different client IDs and redirect URIs.

Note that these scenarios are designed to test potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities, but they may not cover all possible attack vectors or edge cases.
