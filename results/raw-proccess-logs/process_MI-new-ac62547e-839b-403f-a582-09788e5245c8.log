Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights.

Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.

```scss
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization on News Search API

Scenario: Attempt to access news search results without proper authentication
Given url http://oas_news_search_client.api/news/search?q=example
And request {
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "queryStringParameters": {
    "q": "example"
  }
}
When method get
Then status 401
And match response contains "Unauthorized"
```
This scenario tests whether the API requires proper authentication by attempting to access news search results without providing any authentication credentials. The `http://oas_news_search_client.api/news/search?q=example` URL is used as an example of a valid request, but with no authentication header or query string parameters. If the API returns a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) and includes the message "Unauthorized" in the response, then the test case passes, indicating that the API requires proper authentication.

2025-01-31 03:16:19,323 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - Here's an example of a security test scenario using Karate DSL to check for Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the `/news/trendingtopics` endpoint:
```kotlin
Feature: Test API for Broken Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities
  Scenario: Check for Broken Authentication/Authorization on /news/trendingtopics endpoint
    Given url http://oas_news_search_client.api/news/trendingtopics
      And request headers { Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>" }
      When method get
        Then status 200
        And match response contains "No description available"
```
This scenario tests the `/news/trendingtopics` endpoint with an access token to check if it returns a valid response. If the endpoint does not require authentication, then this test case will fail as there is no need for an access token. However, if the endpoint requires authentication and the provided access token is invalid or expired, then this test case should succeed in returning a 401 Unauthorized status code and an appropriate error message.
