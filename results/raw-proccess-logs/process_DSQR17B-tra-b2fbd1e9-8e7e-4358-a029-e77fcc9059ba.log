Okay, so I need to create a Karate DSL test script for an API endpoint that's supposed to handle getting streets by postcode. The path is /Place/Address/Streets/{Postcode}, and the method is GET. They mentioned using http://oas_transport_for_london.api as the base URL each time.

First, I should think about what potential vulnerabilities we might be looking for here. Broken authentication or authorization usually refers to issues where an attacker can manipulate tokens or sessions without proper validation. But since this endpoint doesn't seem to involve authentication headers directly—it's a GET request with parameters—maybe it's more about parameter injection attacks.

Wait, the path has {Postcode}, which is likely a required query parameter for the API call. So maybe there are issues where an attacker could inject malicious values into that parameter if not properly sanitized or validated by the server.

I should consider scenarios like:

1. **Invalid Postcode Injection**: If someone sends an invalid postcode, does it cause errors? Or worse, allow access to sensitive data?

2. **Missing Parameters**: What happens when a client forgets to include the required {Postcode}? Does that result in 400 or some other error.

3. **Exploiting Session Tokens**: Wait, but this is just GET and no authentication headers are involved here unless maybe there's an underlying session mechanism elsewhere not shown.

Hmm, since it's a GET request with only one parameter, perhaps the main concern would be ensuring that {Postcode} is properly validated against allowed values to prevent injection of arbitrary data. For example, if someone sends something like 'abc', does the server accept it or treat it as invalid?

Another thought: Maybe there are issues where an attacker could manipulate the URL parameters in a way that bypasses rate limiting or other security measures.

I should structure test cases around these possibilities:

- Test for valid and invalid postcodes to see if they cause errors.
- Check what happens when {Postcode} is missing—does it return 400?
- Ensure that certain characters are allowed, like letters vs. special symbols.

Wait, but the user mentioned "Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities." So maybe I'm overcomplicating with parameter injection; perhaps there's a more direct way to exploit authentication here if an attacker can bypass token validation or session fixation.

But since this endpoint is GET and doesn't involve headers directly, it might not be about header tampering. Maybe the issue lies in how other parts of the system handle tokens—if someone injects malicious data into the URL that somehow affects a subsequent auth flow elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an openID Connect or OAuth integration somewhere else where this endpoint is used to generate tokens for further authentication steps without proper validation on those parameters.

I think I'll proceed by creating test cases around parameter injection and missing required parameters. That way, we can verify that the server correctly handles these scenarios either by returning appropriate errors or denying access as intended.

Alright, let me break down how I approached creating the Karate DSL test script based on the user's query.

Firstly, understanding the API endpoint: It’s a GET request to /Place/Address/Streets/{Postcode} with {Postcode} as a required parameter. The base URL is http://oas_transport_for_london.api.

The main focus was on potential vulnerabilities like broken authentication or authorization. Since it's a GET request without direct headers, I considered issues related to parameter injection and missing parameters rather than traditional auth bypasses.

I thought about scenarios where an attacker might inject malicious data into {Postcode} or cause the server to process invalid inputs improperly. This led me to test cases for valid/invalid postcodes, missing parameters, and special characters in postcodes.

Each step was designed to verify proper error handling by checking status codes and response messages when parameters are incorrect. The goal was to ensure that the endpoint behaves as expected under various conditions without introducing vulnerabilities.

Okay, so I need to create a Karate DSL test script for an API endpoint called `/Vehicle/UlezCompliance` that uses GET requests. The authentication isn't specified here, which means it's probably using some default mechanism like Bearer tokens or maybe basic auth.

First off, since the path is `/Vehicle/UlezCompliance`, I should make sure to use that exact URL in my test cases because even a slight change could mean unauthorized access gets through if someone tries with the wrong path. So any request going to `http://oas_transport_for_london.api/` followed by something else might be allowed, but we need it specifically for `/Vehicle/UlezCompliance`.

Next, authentication isn't specified here, so I have a few possibilities: Bearer tokens or maybe even basic auth credentials like username and password. Without knowing exactly what's being used, my test cases should cover both scenarios to ensure that unauthorized access is properly denied.

For the first scenario where an invalid token might be sent without any authentication header at all, we need to make sure it returns a 401 Unauthorized status with the correct error message indicating missing or incorrect credentials. That way, even if someone tries just sending `GET` without headers, they get blocked immediately.

Then, for valid tokens that don't have authorization rights for this specific endpoint, like maybe an admin token who's supposed to handle vehicle compliance but isn't authorized here, we should expect a 403 Forbidden status with the appropriate message. This ensures that only tokens specifically allowed can access `/Vehicle/UlezCompliance`.

Also, I need to consider cases where someone might try using incorrect credentials for basic auth or an improperly formatted Bearer token. These are common points of attack in APIs and ensuring they're denied is crucial.

I should structure each test case with clear steps: specify the URL path correctly, set up any necessary headers like Authorization if it's a bearer token request, make sure to use GET method since that's how this endpoint is accessed, then check for specific HTTP statuses (like 401 or 403) and ensure error messages match what we expect.

Lastly, I need to remember not to use mock URLs but stick with `http://oas_transport_for_london.api` as given. This ensures that the tests are relevant and don't bypass actual production endpoints.

To test potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities for the `/Vehicle/UlezCompliance` endpoint using Karate DSL, follow these steps:

### Feature
**Test for Unauthorized Access to `/Vehicle/UlezCompliance` Endpoint**

---

#### Scenario: Test for Missing or Invalid Authorization Token
- **Objective:** Ensure unauthorized access is denied when no valid token is provided.
  
  - **Steps:**
    1. Go to `http://oas_transport_for_london.api/VEHICLE/UlezCompliance`.
    2. Send a GET request without any authentication header (e.g., `Authorization` or Bearer Token).
    3. Check the response status.
    4. Verify that it returns a **401 Unauthorized** status with an appropriate message indicating missing credentials.

---

#### Scenario: Test for Invalid Authorization Token
- **Objective:** Ensure access is denied when provided with an invalid token, whether through basic auth or Bearer Token format.

  - **Steps:**
    1. Go to `http://oas_transport_for_london.api/VEHICLE/UlezCompliance`.
    2. Send a GET request with an invalid authentication header:
       - For Basic Auth: `{ "Authorization": "Basic wrongkey" }`
       - For Bearer Token: `Bearer wrong_token`
    3. Check the response status.
    4. Verify that it returns a **401 Unauthorized** status with an appropriate message indicating incorrect credentials.

---

#### Scenario: Test for Unauthorized Access Despite Valid Token
- **Objective:** Ensure access is denied when provided with a valid token but not authorized for this endpoint.

  - **Steps:**
    1. Go to `http://oas_transport_for_london.api/VEHICLE/UlezCompliance`.
    2. Send a GET request with an invalid or non-authorized Bearer Token (e.g., `{ "Authorization": "Bearer valid_token" }`).
    3. Check the response status.
    4. Verify that it returns a **403 Forbidden** status with an appropriate message indicating unauthorized access.

---

### Summary
This test ensures:
1. Unauthorized requests without any authentication headers are blocked (status `401`).
2. Invalid credentials for basic auth or Bearer Token result in a deny response (`status 401`).
3. Access is denied when provided with an improperly formatted token, even if the token exists elsewhere.

By covering these scenarios, we enforce strict access control policies on `/Vehicle

Okay, so I need to create a Karate DSL test script for an API endpoint in London's transport system. The endpoint is at http://oas_transport_for_london.api and the path is /Mode/{mode}/Arrivals with GET method.

First, what are potential vulnerabilities here? Broken Authentication/Authorization usually means that even if you have valid credentials or tokens, they aren't checked properly against some criteria. Maybe there's a lack of proper validation for required parameters like mode in this case since it's dynamic based on {mode}.

I should think about different scenarios where someone might bypass the authentication check by providing incorrect values but still get through. For example, maybe using an empty string or something that doesn't match any valid modes allowed by the system.

So I'll set up a test scenario for each possible way to exploit this vulnerability:

1. **Invalid Mode**: Send a request with mode as "something" which isn't recognized.
2. **Missing Mode**: Don't include it at all, so the endpoint expects an argument but gets none.
3. **OR 1=1 Trick**: Use a query parameter that's always true to bypass checks without affecting security (though maybe not applicable here).
4. ** injection via redirectUri or other parameters**: Maybe inject malicious code into some part of the request.

Alright, let's break down how I approached creating the Karate test script based on your initial request.

1. **Understanding the API Endpoint**:
   - The endpoint is at `http://oas_transport_for_london.api/Modes/{mode}/Arrivals` and uses GET method.
   - It expects a `{mode}` parameter which likely represents different transport modes (e.g., bus, train).

2. **Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Broken Authentication/Authorization**: The system might not properly validate the provided mode or require additional checks like OR conditions to bypass authentication failures.

3. **Designing Test Scenarios**:
   - I considered various ways an attacker could exploit this endpoint by providing invalid values, missing parameters, using logical tricks (like `1=1`), and parameter injection via redirectUri.

4. **Creating Karate DSL Steps**:
   - Each test case is structured with Given-When-Then format to clearly define the scenario.
   - URLs are correctly formatted according to the API structure.
   - Test descriptions explain what each step aims to verify, ensuring clarity for anyone reviewing the tests.

5. **Ensuring Compliance and Clarity**:
   - The script includes placeholders (`* def test...`) indicating where actual testing logic would be implemented.
   - Each response is expected to contain specific messages that confirm successful exploitation of a vulnerability or absence thereof.

By following these steps, I aimed to create comprehensive tests that effectively verify the system's security against potential vulnerabilities related to mode validation and parameter handling.

   - It expects a `{mode}` parameter which likely represents different transport modes (e.g., bus, train).

2. **Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities**:
   - **Broken Authentication/Authorization**: The system might not properly validate the provided mode or require additional checks like OR conditions to bypass authentication failures.

3. **Designing Test Scenarios**:
   - I considered various ways an attacker could exploit this endpoint by providing invalid values, missing parameters, using logical tricks (like `1=1`), and parameter injection via redirectUri.

4. **Creating Karate DSL Steps**:
   - Each test case is structured with Given-When-Then format to clearly define the scenario.
   - URLs are correctly formatted according to the API structure.
   - Test descriptions explain what each step aims to verify, ensuring clarity for anyone reviewing the tests.

5. **Ensuring Compliance and Clarity**:
   - The script includes placeholders (`* def test...`) indicating where actual testing logic would be implemented.
   - Each response is expected to contain specific messages that confirm successful exploitation of a vulnerability or absence thereof.

By following these steps, I aimed to create comprehensive tests that effectively verify the system's security against potential vulnerabilities related to mode validation and parameter handling.
