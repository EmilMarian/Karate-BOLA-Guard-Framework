Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights.

Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.

Feature: Test API for OAuth Token Generation Flaw

Scenario: Attempt to exploit OAuth token generation with a stolen authorization code

**Scenario 3: OAuth Authorization Code Grant Fuzz Testing**
```karate
Feature: OAuth Authorization Code Grant Fuzz Testing

Scenario: Fuzz test the OAuth authorization process for vulnerabilities
Given url 'http://oas_news_search_client.api/news'

* def clientIds = ['knownClientId', '', '; OR 1=1;', '<script>alert(1)</script>']
* def redirectUris = ['http://legitimate.example.com', 'http://malicious.example.com', 'javascript:alert(1)']

* foreach clientIds, function(clientId) {
    * foreach redirectUris, function(redirectUri) {
        And request {

        And assert response does not contain 'Error'

}
```

Note that these test scripts are designed to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities in the API endpoints. The fuzz testing scenario is intended to identify any issues with the OAuth authorization code grant process, such as allowing unauthorized access or injection of malicious code.
