Feature: Test for Broken Authentication and Authorization on User Publications Access

Scenario: Attempt to access user publications without being authenticated
Given url 'http://oas_medium.api'
And path '/users/{userId}/publications'

And match response contains "Unauthorized"

Scenario: Authenticate as a regular user and attempt to access another user's publications

And path '/users/' + userId + '/publications'
And header Authorization = 'Bearer <regular_user_token>'
When method get
Then status 403
And match response contains "You do not have permission to access this publication."

Scenario: Authenticate as an admin and attempt to access another user's publications
* def adminUserId = '67890'
Given url 'http://oas_medium.api'
And path '/users/' + adminUserId + '/publications'
And header Authorization = 'Bearer <admin_user_token>'
When method get
Then status 200

Scenario: Authenticate as an editor and attempt to access another user's publications
* def editorUserId = '90123'
Given url 'http://oas_medium.api'
And path '/users/' + editorUserId + '/publications'
And header Authorization = 'Bearer <editor_user_token>'
When method get

And match response contains "Publication details"
```

This test script covers the following scenarios:

1. Attempting to access user publications without being authenticated (should return a 401 Unauthorized error).
2. Authenticating as a regular user and attempting to access another user's publications (should return a 403 Forbidden error).
3. Authenticating as an admin and accessing their own or other users' publications (should return a 200 OK response with publication details).
4. Authenticating as an editor and accessing their own or other users' publications (should return a 200 OK response with publication details).

Note that the `<regular_user_token>`, `<admin_user_token>`, and `<editor_user_token>` placeholders should be replaced with actual API tokens for regular, admin, and editor roles respectively.

```

This test script checks for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities by attempting to access the publication contributors endpoint with different roles (user, guest) and verifying that an unauthorized user receives a 403 status code. The `adminAccess` scenario is used to verify that an authorized admin can successfully retrieve the contributors list.

Note: You may need to adjust the API URL or path depending on your specific environment.
