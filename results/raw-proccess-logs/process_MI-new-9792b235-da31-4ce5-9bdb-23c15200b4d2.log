Bing often flights new features and improvements, and it uses the client ID as a key for assigning traffic on different flights.

Being assigned to multiple conflicting flights can lead to an inconsistent user experience.

```kotlin
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization on News Search API
  Scenario: Attempt to access news search results without authentication
    Given url http://oas_news_search_client.api/news/search?q=test
      And request {
        method: get
      }
    When status code is not 401
      Then match response contains "Unauthorized"
```
This test script checks if the API endpoint returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code when an unauthenticated user attempts to access news search results. If the status code returned by the API is anything other than `401`, it means that authentication is not required for this endpoint, which could be a potential security vulnerability.

Feature: Testing News Trending Topics Endpoint
  Scenario: Check if authentication is required for accessing trending topics
    Given url http://oas_news_search_client.api/news/trendingtopics
    When method get
    Then status code 401
    And match response contains 'Unauthorized'
```
This scenario tests if authentication is required for accessing the trending topics endpoint by sending a GET request to the endpoint without any authentication headers. If the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status code and includes an "Unauthorized" message in the response, then the authentication requirement has been verified.
