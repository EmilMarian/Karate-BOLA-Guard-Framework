2025-02-01 22:49:08,035 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - Here are three scenarios written in Karate DSL to detect potential Broken Authentication and Authorization vulnerabilities on the given API endpoint:

1. **User Information Disclosure**: This scenario checks if an unauthenticated user can access another user's information by trying to fetch a random user's details without any authentication.
```karate
Feature: User Information Disclosure Test
Scenario: Check for unauthorized access of user information
Given url 'http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}'
When method get
Then status 401
And match response contains 'Unauthenticated'
```
2. **Broken Authentication**: This scenario checks if the authentication mechanism is working correctly by trying to authenticate with an invalid username and password.
```karate
Feature: Broken Authentication Test
Scenario: Check for broken authentication mechanism
Given url 'http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}'
And request {username: 'invalidUser', password: 'invalidPassword'}
When method get
Then status 401
```
3. **Authorization Bypass**: This scenario checks if the authorization mechanism is working correctly by trying to access a user's information without proper authorization.
```karate
Feature: Authorization Bypass Test
Scenario: Check for unauthorized access of user information
Given url 'http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}'
And request {username: 'invalidUser', password: 'invalidPassword'}

```karate
Feature: Testing Follow Functionality with Privacy Respect
Scenario: Dynamically testing follow functionality, respecting user privacy settings
Steps:
|  |
Given url 'http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}/follows'
And header Authorization = 'Bearer <access_token>'
When method get
Then status 200
And match response contains 'Followed user successfully.'
|  |
Given url 'http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}/follows'
And header Authorization = 'Bearer <access_token>'
When method get
Then status 403
And match response contains 'User has set their profile to private.'
```
In this test, we first make a GET request to the `/users/{user-id}/follows` endpoint with an access token. If the user is following another user and respecting privacy settings, then the status should be 200 and the response should contain 'Followed user successfully.' However, if the user has set their profile to private, then attempting to follow them will result in a 403 error with the message 'User has set their profile to private'.

Please replace `<access_token>` with an actual access token for testing.

The last one is missing some information about the API endpoint. Please provide more details or clarify your question if you need help with that.

1. Authorization Bypass: User ID Enumeration Scenario
```karate
Feature: Authorization Bypass: User ID Enumeration
Scenario: Detect and prevent unauthorized access through User ID enumeration
Given url 'http://api.example.com/user/profile'
And param userId = 'user123'
And header Authorization = 'Bearer <user_token>'
When method get
Then status 403
And match response.contains('Unauthorized access attempt detected')
Given param userId = 'authenticatedUserId'
When method get
Then status 200
And match response.contains('User profile data')
```
1. Test API for OAuth Token Generation Flaw Scenario
```karate
Feature: Test API for OAuth Token Generation Flaw
Scenario: Attempt to exploit OAuth token generation with a stolen authorization code
Given url 'http://api.example.com/oauth/token'
And request { grant_type: 'authorization_code', code: 'stolen_code', redirect_uri: 'http://evil.example.com', client_id: 'client_id', client_secret: 'client_secret' }
When method post
Then status 400
And match response contains 'Invalid grant: authorization code is invalid'
```
Please provide more details about the API endpoint you want to test, and I will generate a Karate DSL script for that.
