2025-01-31 02:18:04,805 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - Here's an example of a security test scenario using Karate DSL to check for Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the API endpoint `/users/{userId}/publications`:
```kotlin
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization on /users/{userId}/publications
  Scenario: Attempt to access a user's publications without proper authentication or authorization
    Given url http://oas_medium.api/users/{userId}/publications
    And header Authorization = 'Bearer <invalid_token>'
    When method get
    Then status 401
    And match response contains 'Unauthorized'
```
In this scenario, we are attempting to access a user's publications without proper authentication or authorization. The `Authorization` header is set to an invalid token, and the API endpoint returns a 401 Unauthorized error with the message "Unauthorized". This indicates that the request was not properly authenticated or authorized.

To test for this vulnerability, you can run this scenario multiple times with different invalid tokens to see if any of them work. If they do, then there may be a Broken Authentication/Authorization issue on the API endpoint.

Scenario: Attempt to access user details without authentication

This test case checks if the `/me` endpoint requires authentication by attempting to access it with an unauthenticated user. If the server responds with a `401 Unauthorized` status code and includes the message "Unauthorized", then the API is secure against Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities.

2025-01-31 02:36:31,001 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - Here's an example of how you could write a security test case using Karate DSL scenario for checking Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the given API endpoint:
```kotlin
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization on Publications Contributors Access
  Scenario: Attempt to access publications contributors without proper authentication or authorization

    And header Authorization = 'Bearer <regular_user_token>'
    When method get
    Then status 403
    And match response contains 'You do not have permission to access this resource'
```
In this scenario, we are attempting to access the `/publications/{publicationId}/contributors` endpoint without proper authentication or authorization. We use a regular user token as the Authorization header and try to retrieve the list of contributors for a specific publication. If the request is successful, it means that the user has the necessary permissions to access this resource.

You can customize this scenario further by adding additional steps to check if the response contains any other information or error messages related to authentication/authorization failure. Additionally, you may want to include scenarios for different types of tokens and roles to ensure comprehensive testing.
