2025-01-26 04:39:54,355 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - Here is a sample Karate DSL test script to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities:
```kotlin
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization on /me endpoint
  Scenario: Attempt to access user data without proper authentication
    Given url http://oas_uber.api/me
    And request { method: GET }
    When status is not 401
      Then response contains "User not found"
```
This test script checks if the `/me` endpoint returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code when an unauthenticated user attempts to access it. If the status code returned is anything other than `401`, then there may be a Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerability in the system.
