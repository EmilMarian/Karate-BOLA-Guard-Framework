```
This test scenario checks if a user can access another user's profile without authorization by making an unauthenticated GET request to the `/users/{user-id}` endpoint. If the user is able to access the other user's profile, it indicates that there may be a Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerability in the API.

This test script checks if the endpoint returns a 200 status code and if it includes the message "Followed user successfully". It also verifies that the response does not include the message "Unauthorized access attempt detected", which would indicate a Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerability.

Feature: Testing Follow Functionality with Privacy Respect
  Scenario: Dynamically test the ability to follow a user, respecting their privacy settings
    Given url http://oas_instagram.api/users/{user-id}/followed-by
    And request { userIdToFollow: publicUserId }
    When method get

    And request { userIdToFollow: publicUserId }
    When method get
    Then status 403
    And match response contains 'User has set their profile to private.'
```
This test script checks for two scenarios, one where the user being followed is a public user and another where the user being followed is a private user. In both cases, we are making GET requests to the `/users/{user-id}/followed-by` endpoint with an appropriate request payload. We then check the response status code and message to ensure that the follow functionality works as expected and respects privacy settings.
