This script consists of three scenarios:

1. The first scenario attempts to access the merchant details without authentication, which should result in a `401 Unauthorized` response.
2. The second scenario tries to access the merchant details as an unauthorized user (e.g., editor), which should also result in a `403 Forbidden` response due to lack of permissions.
3. The third scenario accesses the merchant details as an authorized user (e.g., admin) with valid authentication, which should return a successful response (`200 OK`).
