2025-01-26 00:10:54,394 - karate_compatibility_verifier - INFO - Here is a sample Karate DSL test script to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the given API endpoint:
```kotlin
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization on /users/{userId}/publications Endpoint
  Scenario: Attempt to access publications without proper authentication or authorization
    Given url http://oas_medium.api/users/{userId}/publications
    And header Authorization = 'Bearer <invalid_token>'
    When method get
    Then status 401
    And match response contains 'Unauthorized'
```
This test script checks if the API endpoint returns a `401 Unauthorized` error when an invalid token is provided in the Authorization header. If the API endpoint does not return this error, it may indicate that authentication or authorization checks are broken and unauthorized access could be possible.
