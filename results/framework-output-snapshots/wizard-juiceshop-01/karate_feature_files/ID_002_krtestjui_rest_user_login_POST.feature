Here's a Karate DSL test script to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the `/rest/user/login` endpoint:
```karate
Feature: Testing for Broken Authentication and Authorization
  Scenario Outline: Verify proper authentication and authorization handling
    Given url 'http://192.168.1.112:3133/rest/user/login'
    Examples:
      | username | password | expected_status | expected_message |
      | admin     | admin     | 401            | Unauthorized access|
      | guest     | incorrectPassword | 401            | Incorrect credentials|
      | existingUser | wrongPassword | 401            | Incorrect username or password|
```
This script checks for potential Broken Authentication and Authorization vulnerabilities by ensuring that the application responds with appropriate error messages when invalid credentials are provided. It also tests if unauthorized access is denied, preventing attackers from gaining unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
