```yaml
feature: Security Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization on /identity/api/auth/verify Endpoint
  scenario: Verify that the authentication endpoint does not allow unauthorized access or enumeration of valid credentials
    given url 'http://192.168.1.112:8888/identity/api/auth/verify'
    
    # Attempt to authenticate with a non-existent user and invalid password, expecting an unauthorized response or error message that does not reveal sensitive information
    when request { username: 'non_user', password: 'wrongpassword123!' }
    then status 401 # Assuming the API returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized for failed authentication attempts, but this should be verified with actual response data from your application. Adjust based on real behavior and expected error messages to ensure sensitive information is not disclosed in responses.
    
    // Attempting a valid user-credential pair that does not exist (to test if the API responds differently for known vs unknown users)
    when request { username: 'existing_user', password: 'wrongpassword123!' } # Replace with an actual existing but non-authenticated user to avoid security risks. This step should be handled carefully in a real environment, ensuring no sensitive data is exposed or used maliciously.
    then status 401 // Expecting the same unauthorized response as above; however, ensure that this does not disclose any information about valid credentials through error messages. Adjust based on actual API behavior and compliance with security best practices.
    
    # Additional steps can be added to further test for vulnerabilities such as:
    // Checking if the endpoint responds differently when using a known but non-authenticated user's details, which could indicate potential information leakage or enumeration issues. This step should also adhere strictly to security best practices and ethical guidelines in testing environments.
