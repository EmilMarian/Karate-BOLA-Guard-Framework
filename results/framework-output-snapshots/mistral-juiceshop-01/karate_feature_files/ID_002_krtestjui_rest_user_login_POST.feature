Here is a Karate DSL scenario to test for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the `/rest/user/login` endpoint:
```kotlin
Feature: Testing for Broken Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities
  Scenario: Verify that the login process requires valid credentials
    Given url http://192.168.1.112:3133/rest/user/login
    And request { username: 'valid_username', password: 'valid_password' }
    When method post
    Then status 200
    And match response contains 'Successfully logged in.'
```
This scenario checks that the `/rest/user/login` endpoint requires valid credentials to be provided in order to successfully log in. If an attacker is able to bypass this requirement, they may gain unauthorized access to the system.
