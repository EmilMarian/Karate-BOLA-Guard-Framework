Here is a sample Karate DSL test script to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the given API endpoint:
```kotlin
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities
  Scenario: Attempt to access protected resource without authentication
    Given url http://192.168.1.112:3133/api/Users/
    And request method POST
    When status code is not 401
      Then match response contains "Unauthorized"
```
This test script checks if the API endpoint returns a `401 Unauthorized` status code when an unauthenticated user attempts to access it. If the status code returned by the server is anything other than `401`, then there may be a Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerability in the system.
