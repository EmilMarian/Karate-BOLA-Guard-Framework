Here is the Karate DSL test script to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the `/identity/api/auth/signup` endpoint:

```karate
Feature: Test API for Account Enumeration during Signup

Scenario: Verify that the signup process does not allow account enumeration
Given url 'http://192.168.1.112:8888/identity/api/auth/signup'
And request { username: 'newUser', password: 'Password123!', email: 'new@user.com' }
When method post
Then status 200
And match response contains 'A verification email has been sent. Please check your inbox.'
```

This test scenario attempts to sign up a new user with an existing username, expecting the API to respond with a successful message and not allow account enumeration.

Please note that this is just one possible way to test for Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the `/identity/api/auth/signup` endpoint using Karate DSL. You may need to modify or add more scenarios based on your specific requirements and testing goals.
