Here is a sample Karate DSL test script to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the API endpoint `http://192.168.1.112:8888/workshop/api/merchant/contact_mechanic` using POST method:
```kotlin

Note: The above test script assumes that the API endpoint requires authentication using a token, and that there are different levels of authorization required to perform certain actions. You may need to modify the script based on your specific requirements and implementation details.
