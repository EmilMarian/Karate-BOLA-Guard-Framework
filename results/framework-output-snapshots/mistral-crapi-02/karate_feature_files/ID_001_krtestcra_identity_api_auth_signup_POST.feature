Here is a Karate DSL test script to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the `/identity/api/auth/signup` endpoint:
```kotlin
Feature: Testing for Broken Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities
  Scenario: Verify that the signup process does not allow account enumeration
    Given url http://192.168.1.112:8888/identity/api/auth/signup
    And request { username: 'existingUser', password: 'Password123!', email: 'existing@example.com' }
    When method post
    Then status 400
    And match response contains "Invalid grant"
```
This scenario checks for Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities by attempting to sign up with an existing user account and verifying that the application responds with a `400 Bad Request` error, indicating that the request is invalid. This indicates that the application does not allow account enumeration attacks.
