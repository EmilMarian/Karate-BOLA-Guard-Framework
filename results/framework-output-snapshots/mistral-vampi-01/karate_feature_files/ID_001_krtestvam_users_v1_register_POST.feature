Here is a Karate DSL test script to check for potential Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities on the `/users/v1/register` endpoint:
```kotlin
Feature: Test for Broken Authentication/Authorization on /users/v1/register Endpoint
  Scenario: Attempt to register with invalid credentials
    Given url http://192.168.1.112:3133/users/v1/register
    And request { username: 'invalid_user', password: 'password' }
    When method post
    Then status 401
    And match response contains 'Invalid credentials'
```
This scenario checks if the endpoint responds with a `401 Unauthorized` status code when an invalid username and password are provided. If it does, then the endpoint is considered to have Broken Authentication/Authorization vulnerabilities as it allows unauthenticated access to sensitive resources.
