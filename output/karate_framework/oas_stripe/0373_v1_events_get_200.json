For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`\nevent, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an\n`invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple\nevents. For example, if you create a new subscription for a\ncustomer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a\n`charge.succeeded` event.\n\nEvents occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event's data\nfield embeds the resource's state at the time of the change. For\nexample, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an\n`invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.\n\nAs with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an\n[individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)\nfrom the API. We also have a separate\n[webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the\n`Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage\nwebhooks in your\n[account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how\nto [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks)\nso that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.\n\nWhen using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications\nthat occur in connected accounts. For these events, there's an\nadditional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.\n\nWe only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event)\nfor 30 days.",
