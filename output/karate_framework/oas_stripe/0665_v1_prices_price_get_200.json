This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single \"gold\" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and \u20ac9 once.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription), [create an invoice](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/create), and more about [products and prices](https://stripe.com/docs/products-prices/overview).",
