An invoice item is added to an\ninvoice by creating or updating it with an `invoice` field, at which point it will be included as\n[an invoice line item](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/line_item) within\n[invoice.lines](https://stripe.com/docs/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).\n\nInvoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined\nwith a [subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions). Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge\nor credit the customer\u2019s card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges\n(to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.\n\nRelated guides: [Integrate with the Invoicing API](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration), [Subscription Invoices](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/subscription#adding-upcoming-invoice-items).",
