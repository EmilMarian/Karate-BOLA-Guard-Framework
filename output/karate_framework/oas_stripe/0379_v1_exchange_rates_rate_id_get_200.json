Since this number is variable\nthroughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to know the current\nrate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user with a default\npayment in a foreign currency).\n\nPlease refer to our [Exchange Rates API](https://stripe.com/docs/fx-rates) guide for more details.\n\n*[Note: this integration path is supported but no longer recommended]* Additionally,\nyou can guarantee that a charge is made with an exchange rate that you expect is\ncurrent. To do so, you must pass in the exchange_rate to charges endpoints. If the\nvalue is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please refer to our\n[Using with charges](https://stripe.com/docs/exchange-rates) guide for more details.\n\n-----\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*This Exchange Rates API is a Beta Service and is subject to Stripe's terms of service. You may use the API solely for the purpose of transacting on Stripe.
