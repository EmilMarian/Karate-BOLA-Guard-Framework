Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.\n\nFor example, you might have a single \"gold\" product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, \u20ac9/month, and \u20ac90/year.\n\nRelated guides: [Set up a subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/set-up-subscription) and more about [products and prices](https://stripe.com/docs/products-prices/overview).",
